                    <ul>
                        <li>Americans discard nearly 40 tons of food every year.</li>
                        <li>30-40% of the US food supply is wasted.</li>
                        <li>Food is the single largest component taking up space inside US landfills.</li>

                    <p>With FoodShare, we hope to reduce food waste by reallocating it to those who need it the most.

                        <br>kitchens, who will arrange to pick it up and redistribute it to those in need.
